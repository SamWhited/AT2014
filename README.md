# Appalachian Trail

On 16 April, 2014 I set out to thru-hike the Appalachian National Scenic Trail
(AT) from Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia, to Baxter State Park in Maine.
On 06 Oct, 2014 I became the 797th person to complete the 2184 mile thru-hike
for 2014.

During my time on the trail I used a custom app for Android
([Checkin](https://github.com/SamWhited/checkin)) to record GeoJSON data about
my trip. That data (as well as other data and analysis of my journey) is stored
in this repo.
